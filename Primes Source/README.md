The primes_primRoot2.txt file contains the primes without the beginning comments from b001122.txt. These primes were outsourced from The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) and can be found at this link https://oeis.org/A001122. 

We use this source in particular, as it contains a list of primes that all have a primitive root of 2. ElGamal requires a prime modulus and corresponding primitive root of that prime. Because finding a primitive root of a given prime is not straightforward and is not part of our time calculations and comparisons between the two cryptosystems. As there are 10000 primes with a primitive root of 2 supplied in this list, we found it sufficient for our purposes.
